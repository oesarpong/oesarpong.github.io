                        For this stunt, the robot 
                        will start at a designated line, drive forward as fast as possible, before reaching a wall in which it will perform a flip, and return back 
                        in the direction of where it came from.

                        To accomplish this flip, I divided the problem into two steps: forward and reverse. The robot would run to the setpoint and once this setpoint would actuate the wheels to spin 
                        in the reverse at full speed. This is a callable command, 
                        <span class="fw-medium" style="color: tomato;">FLIP</span>(), which is shown below.

                    <p class="fw-light">
                        On of the key factors to making the RC Car flip is going to be the center of mass (COM). By adding additional weight to front of the car, I can shift the COM toward the front axis, giving a larger torque about those wheels aiding
                        in the flipping motion of the car. To do this, I used a lot of nuts and duck tape. Below is the before and after.

                        This method actually worked surprisingly well. During my test, I noticed that I did not need to rely as heavily on a grippy surface because there was enough weight to pick the back wheels off of the ground.

                    <p class="fw-light">
                        Overall, I believe that the solution I came up with was acceptable. I found the flip task to be easier then the drift task due to simplified trouble shooting, 
                        seeing as I did not need to adjust any controller but included more open loop commands. In my case, one of the most pivotal features affecting performance
                        was the <span class="fw-medium">amount of dirt build up on the wheels.</span> The successful attempts shown above were after whiping the wheels off to reduce the amount of slipping 
                        caused. Therefore, although my results were repeatable there was a signficiant amount of environmental control/intervention that was needed to develop this uniformity. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-light">
                        Another area of interest within these attempts is the setpoint. Based on the graphs, the RC robot was sending inputs to reverse earlier then when it actually flipped and started moving in the desired direction. The TOF sensor data
                        reaching zero actually shows when the flip started. 
                        This can be explained by the cars overwhelming momentum which had to be counteracted by an opposing force. Therefore, to get the flip to happen closer to the wall I indulged in a significant
                        amount of tuning in order to predict where the robot would flip. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-light">
                        Finally, to my surprise, I ended up not using active braking to intiate this flip seeing as <span class="fw-medium">the momentum at a max PWM input would still overcome the holding torque</span> applied to the motors. Therefore in the 
                        priority of speed, the method I chose can be described as a rotation assist which aids the car in making the flip after an abrupt change in inputs that would raise the rear of the car. 
                    </p>

                        To do this, I drove the robot at a constant motor speed and logged the input U and the distance readings. In order to create a model that could accomdate my positonal controller,
                        I choose an <span class="fw-medium">PWM value of 255</span> to match what was used in Lab 5. Below are the results of this step response.

                    <p class="fw-light">
                        The velocity derivation produced very noisy results which made it difficult to interpret the system's response. I spent a significant amount of time attempting to understand 
                        why this was the case. I use this space to offer a few theories as to what is going on:

                                The step-like response of the distance values are caused by the slow integration time of the sensors leading to 
                                the same measurements being output. This results in a velocity of 0, which I filtered out of the above figure. To decrease the lengths of these steps, 
                                I reduced the intermeasurement time to be closer to the timing budget of the sensor.

                                Some noise is genuinely to be expected as each looping time between recorded measurements will have some variance. There are numerous factors that could be affecting 
                                this variation which can go come from EMI to physical disturbance like overheating.

                        the results converge closer to our setpoint. The KF makes a prediciton of the response then filters the model using the measured values.

                            a low process noise may ignore rapid deviations in the data, but will favor the motion model. Additionally, if we set these terms to zero then we will get a straight line.

                        After adjusting parameters for some time, I concluded that the issue actually may be found in my prediciton for the motion model. Considering the noise in my velocity response, 
                        my fit could have easily been an overshoot of the actual velocity of my system. Therefore, I adjusted my values for d and m using smaller approximations from my velocity data.
                        After doing this I was able to reduce the spikes in my data which I believe to be a result of an over-estimate of the robots velocity.

                        Due to limited time, I ended up settling for a satisfactory solution. Comparing my Kalman filter to the Tof data, I think I would prefer my Tof data which now returns new values much quicker then before.
                        I intend to recreate a better model of my system and reinstate a better Kalman Filter that better predicts the distance measurements and smooths out my response.
